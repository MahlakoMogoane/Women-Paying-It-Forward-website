We have our days where we don't see eye to eye. At the moment, since being with you in the program,  things have changed alot. We are able to work through situations that concerns us most.

                  Thank you so much for allowing us to see the rewards of your hard work. When I received your message  concerning the sponsor for the ticket, tears started rolling from my eyes. Iam literally crying as Iam sending this msg to you. I've been struggling to get the R600 for my husband and myself to attend this awsome event. Thank thank thank you so so much! May God enlarge your territory and bless the work of your hands. May your cup overflows with goodness and may you continue to do the good work HE placed in your. Thank you once again and enjoy your day.

                <p class="card-text">
                  When Ms. Tas joined the program, she was very quiet , introverted, and not very confident. 
Though a beautiful,  intelligent, and brave young girl... she often  retreated within herself.
During the mentorship program 
Ms. Tas showed remarkable improvement in her self confidence. .
I saw this young lady, grow stronger in her pursuit of being an outstanding leader and follower of Christ.

Her relationship with me, as well as her family, also indicated this shift in Ms Tas.

She has become more focused and  determined to see her life take the shape that she has envisioned.

Ms. Tas has evolved into a stronger and more courageous young woman, who I am certain is becoming a force to be reckonned with.

                <p class="card-text">Lisa is a bright and ambitious individual, radiating enthusiasm and curiosity. With  an open mind and eagerness to learn, she embodies the ideal qualities of a mentee.

                  Her infectious optimism and warm smile create a delightful presence, making every interaction a joy. Lisa's determination to grow and excel is inspiring, and her resilience in the face of challenges is admirable.
                  
                  As her mentor, I've witnessed Lisa's remarkable progress, fostered by her:
                  
                  1. Inquisitive nature: Asking thoughtful questions and seeking guidance.
                  2. Receptive attitude: Embracing feedback and constructive criticism.
                  3. Persistent effort: Overcoming obstacles and striving for excellence.
                  
                  Lisa's growth under my guidance is a testament to her dedication and my nurturing mentorship. I've helped unlock her potential, empowering her to:
                  
                  1. Develop confidence.
                  2. Refine skills.
                  3. Pursue passions.
                  
                  My mentorship has instilled valuable life skills, shaping Lisa into a capable and compassionate individual poised for success.</p>
